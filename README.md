# Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Gym Website

## Project Overview

This is a WIP! Goal to completion is January 2025!

This project is a modern, high-performance website for a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu gym, showcasing advanced web development skills and best practices. It demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, along with implementation of responsive design, state management, and RESTful API architecture.

## Key Technical Aspects

### Frontend Development
- **React.js**: Utilized for building a dynamic and efficient user interface
  - Implemented functional components and React Hooks for state management
  - Used custom hooks for shared logic across components
- **React Router**: Employed for seamless, client-side routing
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented using Tailwind CSS
  - Ensures optimal viewing experience across all device sizes
  - Utilized Tailwind's utility-first approach for rapid UI development
- **State Management**: Leveraged React's Context API for global state management
  - Implemented custom reducers for complex state logic
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Utilized React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting
  - Implemented memoization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Backend Development
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Used to create a robust and scalable server
  - Implemented MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for clear separation of concerns
- **RESTful API**: Designed and implemented a RESTful API for data operations
  - Utilized proper HTTP methods and status codes
  - Implemented input validation and error handling middleware
- **MongoDB with Mongoose**: 
  - Designed efficient database schemas
  - Implemented indexing for optimized query performance
- **Authentication & Authorization**: 
  - Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
  - Role-based access control for different user types (e.g., admin, regular users)

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Version Control**: Utilized Git with a feature branch workflow
- **Environment Management**: Implemented dotenv for environment variable management
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up automated testing and deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions

### Security Measures
- Implemented CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies
- Used Helmet.js to set various HTTP headers for app security
- Implemented rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Sanitized user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks

### Testing
- Implemented unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Utilized Supertest for API endpoint testing

### Additional Features
- **Dynamic Class Schedule**: 
  - Implemented a flexible, database-driven class schedule system
  - Developed an admin interface for easy schedule updates
- **Instructor Profiles**: 
  - Created a dynamic system for managing and displaying instructor information
- **Contact Form**: 
  - Implemented form validation on both client and server side
  - Integrated with NodeMailer for sending email notifications
- **Google Reviews Integration**: 
  - Utilized Google Places API to fetch and display gym reviews

## Technological Proficiencies Demonstrated
- Advanced React.js development techniques
- Server-side JavaScript with Node.js and Express.js
- NoSQL database management with MongoDB
- RESTful API design and implementation
- Responsive web design with modern CSS frameworks
- Full-stack JavaScript development
- Version control with Git
- Deployment and DevOps practices
- Web security best practices
- Testing methodologies in JavaScript ecosystems

This project showcases a comprehensive skill set in modern web development, from frontend user experience to backend architecture, database management, and DevOps practices. It demonstrates the ability to create scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications using cutting-edge technologies and best practices in the field.
